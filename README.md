# Algorithms-and-data-structures
Some algorithms and data structures in C/C++

1. Graphs - implementation of graph and priority queue using binary heap. It is used in Dijkstra, Prim and Kruskal algorithms. There are also some algorithms to walk through graph and tests.
2. Queues&Lists - FIFO, LIFO, linked list and circular list.
3. Selection - RandomSelect, Select (also with different number of groups to sort), BinarySearch and using Selection in QuickSort.
4. Sorting- InsertionSort, MergeSOrt, QuickSort, DualPivotQuickSort and some connections beetwen them to create faster algorithm.
5. Trees - BST, RBT, Splay, HashMap with list and trees
